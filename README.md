# WizardTileEntityBlocker

A simple plugin requested by Historycraft.fr to block the usage of certain Tile entities.

- To block a Material in a certain world, use the command `/teb block <world name be here> <material name>`
- To see the list of blocked Materials, just use `/teb list <world name>`
- To remove a block from the blocked list, you will have to edit the `config.yml` file directly

You can use the pseudo world `any` to block Materials on all worlds.

You can see the Materials list on [this Spigot page](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html).

So far it only works for Grindstones and Anvils, because it was what i was asked to do.
